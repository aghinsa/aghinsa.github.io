Hey,

I'm Aghin, a Computer Science undergrad in Indian Institute Of Techonology Madras. Most of my projects are on machine-deep-reinforcement learning. Apart from acads i'm also interested in random physics facts, all kind of geeky stuff, mangas and anime. I go by *aghinsa* everywhere online so if you have any suggestions or comments about anything feel free to ping me.
