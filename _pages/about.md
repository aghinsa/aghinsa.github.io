Hi,I'm Aghin.

So i was going through some repos and stumbled upon a couple of gh-pages and thought *"hey,this'd be cool"* end of origin story.A little about myself,I'm currently a CS undergrad in Indian Institute Of Techonology,Madras.Most of my interests/projects are on machine-deep-reinforcement learning.I read a lot,mostly manga.Interested in all sorts of tech,aliens and conspiracy theories.I go by *aghinsa* almost everywhere online so if you have any suggestions or comments about anything feel free to ping me.
