## What did I do this week?
I worked on setting up a DataFlow for continuous deployment of Docker containers. This is not related to
the project, but still pretty cool stuff. With the new flow now you can push your changes to GitHub and it'll
automatically pull and redeploy the defined containers. For the project, I have been reading on [Nats.io](https://nats.io/). We had meetings in the community (on Tuesdays and Fridays), in which everyone was updated with the changes in the codebase, and John (Mentor) cleared few of our doubts.

## What is coming up next?
Before the coding week starts, I'm planning to work on a few more issues in the repo, specifically to support
entrypoint style loading of operations in creating dataflow config files.

## Did you get stuck anywhere?
There were a few places where I was confused, but my mentor is very active so most of the roadblocks were cleared by the day.
