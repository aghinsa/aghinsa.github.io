Reconstructing a 3d model from  2d images would be awesome.For one on our club projects at [Envisage](shaastra.org/envisage), we decided to give it a shot. This post is  about different stuffs which were tried.

## Computer Vison way,Enter OpenMvg and OpenMvs
[OpenMVG](https://github.com/openMVG/openMVG),[OpenMVS](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS) are libraries for solving for multi view geometry/reconstruction problems among other things.You can find my implementation [here](https://github.com/aghinsa/OpenMvg-mvs).It's undocumented for the time being,sorry!.From 3 imaged it was able to reconstruct this

## Can't Solve it ,lets try learning from data!!
I found [this paper](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~zlun/SketchModeling/) very interesting and started implementing it to suit our needs. Due to hardware limitation never managed to finish training, and after the club event the project went stale. The intermediatary outputs seems promising though :D. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/aghinsa/SketchTo3D)
