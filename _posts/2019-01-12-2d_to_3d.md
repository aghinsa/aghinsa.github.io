Reconstructing a 3d model from  2d images would be awesome.For one on our club projects at [Envisage](shaastra.org/envisage), I decided to give it a shot.I googled around and found some interesting things.This page is mostly about what i tried for the project.

## Computer Vison way,Enter OpenMvg and OpenMvs  
[OpenMVG](https://github.com/openMVG/openMVG),[OpenMVS](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS) are libraries for solving for multi view geometry/reconstruction problems among other things.You can find my implementation [here](https://github.com/aghinsa/OpenMvg-mvs).It's undocumented for the time being,sorry!.From 3 imaged it was able to reconstruct this

## Can't Solve it ,try a Neural Network!!
On reading further,i came across some interesting papers and decided to implement the paper describe [here](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~zlun/SketchModeling/).Due to hardware constraints i never managed to finish training and after the club event the project went stale.The intermediatary output seems promising though.

* step 3000 :
