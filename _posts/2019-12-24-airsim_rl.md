### Work In Progress
The idea started as a warmup project for an intern,but before the project began my intern period was over.Since i wanted to explore RL more i thought it'd be good idea to continue this on.


## The Plan
* Python script which makes uses of Airsim api to collect data.
* Collect data by running the script on [Neighborhood environment](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/releases).
* Write an RL agent which uses the data to learn to plan path.

## Data Generation - AirSim.
After searching around for many simulators,i have decided to use [Airsim](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim) from Microsoft to generate data.

To be continued..
